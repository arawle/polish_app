== Polish App

Summary
* Post and track your polish collection in a user interactive site. There is currently no site which does this for nail polish collectors, and I have found many who have interest in using this type of technology. This has implications for being translatable to other types of collections such as baseball cards, records, cosmetics.

* An individual user can keep track of their entire nail polish collection. Users can mark polishes as for sale or for swap. There will be features implemented for both the casual enthusiast as well as bloggers.

* Bloggers will have additional options to keep track of what polishes theyâ€™ve blogged about, as well as adding a blog photo of the post and a link to the post.

* Users can add what they paid for a polish. This will allow for data visualization for individual polishes based on current and paid prices.
