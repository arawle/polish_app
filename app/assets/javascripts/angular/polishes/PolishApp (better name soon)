PolishApp (better name soon)
Summary

Post and track your polish collection in a user-interactive site.

An individual user can keep track of their entire collection. Users can mark polishes as for sale or for swap. There will be features implemented for both the casual enthusiest as well as the

Users can add what they paid for a polish in the state that they create. This will allow for data visualization for individual polishes based on current and paid prices. This would be more accurate and easier to track once I can implement sales between user on the site, instead of through email.

Users can search the full list of polishes on the website. Individual polishes will have lists of their states. Polish states listed as for swap or for sale will appear outlined in green. Users will be able to sort based on the availability status.

The app will have pagination for scaleability.

Users can sort all the polishes by Brand to see all of one specific brand.(Each brand will have a homepage).

 Users interested in a particular polish and state can click a link to generate an email to the owner. Email will include the requesters userprofile address, as well as contact information.

MVP

There is currently no site which does this for nail polish collectors, and I have found many who have interest in using this type of technology. This has implications for being translateable to other types of collections such as baseball cards, records, cosmetics.

Additional features
Fully polished UI
Ability to message a user within the app instead of sending through email. This will allow for polish states to be transferred from one user to another on a successfull sale. I'm thinking about Mailboxer, but suggestions are welcome.
